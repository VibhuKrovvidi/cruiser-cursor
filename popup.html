    <h1>Cruiser Cursor</h1>
    <h2>Be smart, move your wrist less</h2>
    <p>
      Cruiser Cursor allows users to avoid moving their wrists by providing them a smart cursor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Simply begin moving your mouse and Cruiser Cursor will try to find the most relevant clickable object in that direction.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, with a simple gesture, you can choose to click, saving you time and energy as you browse the web!
